# About the 16-QAM-system-BER
Its a python script to estimate the BER of a 16-QAM system. The script takes into account factors suchas a fading channel, channel equalization, and channel coding.
Its used a Reed-Solomon (63,59) for the channel coding and the zero Forcing algorithm for the channel equalization.
